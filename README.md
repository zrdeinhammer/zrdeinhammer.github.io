My GitHub account currently contains only one repository, named zrdeinhammer.github.io, along with the README file included within it. From the main page, you can add, clone, or create a new repository. You can also see all of the changes made to the repository, along with how long ago these were made, and any commits added. There is also a help option where you can report any issues or contact GitHub support for assistance.

The repository I created, named zrdeinhammer.github.io, only has the main branch and the README file contained within it.

To clone the repository, I had to download the desktop app for GitHub, sign in with my account, then click on the "+" button to select which repository I wished to clone. After doing so, I selected where I wanted this file to be stored on my  omputer then cloned the repository.
